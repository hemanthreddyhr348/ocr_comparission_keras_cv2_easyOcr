A mini project ot check how much time is taken by different libraries to do ocr and how good the extractions are. 

I have come to conclusion that OCR is better done using cloud platforms like amazon textract.... also recently i have been going through 
the agentic document extraction by https://va.landing.ai/ which is very good at extracting the handwritten texts. 
please do check the website for the same and try it.

.md files are the results of two different librarties where as the .jpg file outside the images folder is the processed image that is 
fed to the code during the function calling. I have taken only 3 random text images online to check the output.
