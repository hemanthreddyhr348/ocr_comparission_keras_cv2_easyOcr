A mini project ot check how much time is taken by different libraries to do ocr and how good the extractions are. 

I have come to conclusion that OCR is better done using cloud platforms like amazon textract.... also recently i have been going through 
the agentic document extraction by https://va.landing.ai/ which is very good at extracting the handwritten texts. 
please do check the website for the same and try it.
